# Loan Prediction using Machine Learning and the Streamlit Web Application

## Background:

Machine learning can often seem technically daunting and over complicated, and it can become difficult to decipher the insights that the technology provides. It can also be a convoluted process when assigning the initial conditions that a machine learning algorithm will use to predict the outcomes that are sought after.

Designing a front-end application that is sufficiently intelligent to interact with a machine learning algorithm in a concise and digestible way can be a saving grace for financial professions to save them valuable time in generating instant predictions regarding an individual's suitability to receive credit, and remove much of the headache that can otherwise be involved in hard-coding the desired metrics and lending criteria into an algorithm.

Streamlit is a brilliant example of a front-end application which offers compatibility with Python, setting the stage for where much of our back-end, machine-learning algorithmic grunt-work may be computed and ultimately interface to establish a polished experience. It is attractive, clean, easy to use, highly interactive, and offers fast itterations, testing and deployment of Python-based prototype applications.

## Our Project:

Perhaps the most crucial decision that a lender must make is to decide which potential clients harbour the least risk of defaulting on any credit that the lender may chose to lend to them. Clasically lenders have, mostly unknowingly, made such decisions through the lense of various biases and prejudice, however including this obvious shortcoming, as well as the increasing bulk of credit applications over time, a fast, cost effective and reliable method of taking the guess-work out of picking profitable clients has become increasingly valuable and necessary.

Our project aims to solve this problem of lending risk by leveraging data science and AI. We use an open-source dataset from Kaggle which contains loan data on Lending Club clients from 2007 through to 2018 as it offers a wealth of information that assists us in establishing a robust machine learning algorithm. Our machine learning model is designed to semi-automate the approval process, optimising the trade-off between revenue that the creditor may generate and losses incured due to borrower default, ultimately minimising much of the risk associated with lending.

We use scikit-learn machine learning packages to generate the predictive algorithm, and couple this back-end with our streamlit front-end for the presentation and demonstration of our model. Our goal is to produce a reliable and efficient solution to improve the overall lending process and streamline employee-machine interactions.

The User Interface of the completed web-based application is as follows:

## How we Got Here:

*The Journey So Far*

##Progress

##Day 1
• 1 : We deep dive into the business problem, and spend our best effort to analyze and prepare the dataset;
• 2:  We build our first ML model, evaluate the quality of it and understand model decisions with interpretability;

## Day 2
• 3: We build and optimize different types of models to find the best one;
• 4: We build and evaluate Neural Network model and compare result with previous models;

## Day 3
• 5: Last, we get practical by deploying and making our best model available publicly

## Day 4
• 6: Front end deployment use Streamlit

## Day 5
• 7: Presentation
