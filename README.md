##Progress

##Day 1
• 1 : We deep dive into the business problem, and spend our best effort to analyze and prepare the dataset;
• 2:  We build our first ML model, evaluate the quality of it and understand model decisions with interpretability;

## Day 2
• 3: We build and optimize different types of models to find the best one;
• 4: We build and evaluate Neural Network model and compare result with previous models;

## Day 3
• 5: Last, we get practical by deploying and making our best model available publicly

## Day 4
• 6: Front end deployment use Streamlit

## Day 5
• 7: Presentation







## Attribution Statement
